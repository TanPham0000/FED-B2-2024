			<h2>Our mission</h2>
			<p>Foam is rooted in the need to make photography accessible for everyone. As a tool that has the potential to connect and encourage dialogue, we serve as a platform for conversation, contemplation and connection with visual culture and the world around us.</p>
			<p>With a critical and open approach, we want to confront and challenge the role of photography. Our series of activities, including exhibitions, publications, debates, and educational programmes, continue to lead us in new ways as we showcase exceptional photography that can question and inspire everyone.</p>
